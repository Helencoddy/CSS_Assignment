    <p class="First_Class">My name is KANYINSOLA HELEN COLE. My love for technology is unbreakable. Technology has the ability to impact lives at a level and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind. The idea that something I create can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology. And, with skill and hard work - anyone can do it.</p>

    <!--<h1>Second section</h1>-->
    <p class="Second_Class">CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more. I've learnt how to style text, margin, box, padding e.t.c </p>

    <p class="Third_Class">Difference between Paddings, Margins, and Borders<i>The difference between padding, Border, and Margin is presented below</i></p>
    <ul class="Blue">
        <li><b>Padding</b> - The inner space between the content and the border of your box.</li>
        <li><b>Border</b> - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above.</li>
        <li><b>Margin</b> - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.</li>
